# Welcome To My Repository 
In this repository reside a few of my projects, both academic and personal.

# Interpy 
Interpy is an interpreter written in Python. The purpose of this project was to develop our own programming language with its own syntax. We tried to make ours as simple as possible and, using the PLY Library (Python Lex and Yacc), it was easy to construct a language of our choosing. 

# Snap Copy Paste
Snap Copy Paste was my capstone project at the University of Dayton with help from Synchrony Financial. SCP was built using the Angular TypeScript framework. Although we are very proud of the progress we had made on SCP, COVID-19 hampered our efforts to make the site completely bug-free. As a result, phone cameras do not work on the site yet, but try it out with a screenshot of text!

# Web Runner
Throughout high school, I worked for a small business called the Bradley Sports Center. Last year I the owner reached out to me about an invoice issue the company was facing and thought my experience could help. After looking into the API of the system they used, I thought it would be best to use Python to automate moving invoices. Thanks to the web runner, what used to take weeks to finish was completed in just a couple of days. Since the company did not have access to the developer API, I had to take a slightly different approach. 

# Tweepy

This was done as apart of a Networking class at the University of Dayton. The goal was to use the Tweepy to crawl various twitter accounts and utilize the full strength of the API. The project can find information on users, look for tweets with a specific keyword(s), find tweets based on latitude and longitude, and even do a Depth-First-Search on a Users twitter accounts. The DFS function is capped because of the limitations in API calls per hour.
